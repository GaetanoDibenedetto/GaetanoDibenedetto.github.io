# About Me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Artificial Intelligence at the Department of Computer Science, University of Bari Aldo Moro, Italy. My research focuses on leveraging Computer Vision techniques to enhance Health Recommender Systems, particularly through Human Pose Estimation and Explainable AI in digital healthcare.

I contribute to the academic community as a Program Committee member for multiple international conferences, including RecSys, UMAP, and AIxIA. Additionally, I have served as an official reviewer for prestigious journals such as IEEE Intelligent Systems and the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies. In my first year as a Ph.D. Candidate, my research was recognized with the Best Paper Award at the Doctoral Consortium of AIxIA 2024, and I have received a few travel grants to support my academic endeavors.

With a background in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Recommender Systems, I am passionate about developing AI-driven solutions to improve user experiences in healthcare and beyond.
