    Title: Multimodal Recommender Systems

      Description: In recent years, the growth of e-commerce and online platforms has increased the availability of information and options for consumers. %With this abundance of choice, it can become challenging for users to navigate through the sea of options and find products or services that fit their preferences. 
      Recommender systems have emerged as a powerful tool to help users find the most relevant products or services based on their historical preferences or behaviors. 
      Indeed, recommender systems have become an integral part of our daily lives by suggesting personalized recommendations for various products and services. Moreover, the tourism industry has the potential to utilize this proficiency in order to enhance tourists' overall journey through tailoring recommendations that specifically address their personal preferences. With the increasing volume of data generated every day, the accuracy and efficiency of these systems have become more critical than ever. 
      The purpose of this study was to explore the potential of multimodal recommender systems that leverage multiple types of data to improve recommendation accuracy. The model chosen to perform the experiments is the CLIP model. The findings of this study demonstrate that incorporating visual information significantly enhances the performance of the recommender system.
       

* Big Data Project

    date: February 2023 - June 2023

    Title: Anomaly prediction in cryptocurrencies market data

      Description: Application of the CRISP-DM methodology for anomaly detection, where an anomaly was defined as a fluctuation of 1\% (both positive and negative) compared to the previous hour's price in Cryptocurrencies. After selecting the Yahoo Finance dataset, an LSTM (long-short term memory) model that works with a stream of data (hourly crypto prices) was used for anomaly detection. To achieve this goal, the entire CRISP-DM pipeline was applied, including business understanding, data understanding, and phases of data preparation such as scaling, clustering, feature selection, data cleaning, data conversion,and aggregating. Once the data was preprocessed and clusters were created, the modeling phase carried out using a LSTM model. The model was applied separately on each cluster composed of cryptocurrencies to predict whether or not the input time period is abnormal over all cryptos within individual anomaly on clusters. Finally, a model evaluation phase was conducted, analyzing F-1 score, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall values to verify its effectiveness.

* Software Engineering for AI Project

    date: October 2022 - January 2023

    Title: Glass Detection for Software Engineering Project

      Description: The goal of the project was to launch an ML model on a server, which used a CNN of mine already pretrained (glass-dect), for the detection of glasses on people's faces, applying the entire Software Engineering pipeline. For AI enabled systems, therefore integrating, in addition to the classic code maintenance phases, also phases for the validation and maintenance of the ML model and of the data used for its training.
           

* Machine Learning Project

  date: March 2022 - July 2022
  
  Title: Glass Detection for Machine Learning

      Description: Starting from the Computer Vision project (see project below), it was decided to analyze and confirm the validity of the proposed model, comparing the performance of our model with some state-of-the-art models such as: VGG, MobileNet, as well as a shallow version of VGG, created by me, starting from the original architecture, which would use a number of trainable parameters similar to our model (about 1 million). For the comparison, in addition to the dataset used for the training of the model, 2 other datasets were selected, having similar characteristics to the one used for the training. Finally, a statistical test (Student's t-test) was performed which allowed the results to be validated also from a statistical point of view.
                 

* Computer Vision Project

  date: March 2022 - June 2022

  Title: Glass Detection for Computer Vision
            
      Description: The goal of the project was to create a CNN (convolutional neural network) called Glass-dect, which could recognize the presence of glasses (both eyeglasses and sunglasses) on a person's face. The interesting feature of the model is that it was trained and tested on a dataset of selfies. This factor complicated the training phase, as selfies are characterized by a spontaneous nature and therefore by a great variety. The use of this type of dataset was chosen to meet the network's objective of being able to be used on mobile devices, during the facial authentication phase, where problems of non-recognition of the subject may occur, due to the fact that the subject is wearing glasses. Furthermore, the characteristic of wanting to use the model on mobile devices, which in themselves have a modest computational capacity, has set a further objective of making the model as light as possible (1 < million parameters). Finally, in order to try to improve the classification performance, it was decided to adopt an ensemble technique, by training 5 CNNs (all with the same architecture) but each with a different pre-processed version of the input data. To perform the classifications of the test samples, a majority vote was performed, based on the independent predictions of each individual CNN. This idea was "borrowed" from considering the union of many "weak learners" to improve performance, as is done in the AdaBoost algorithm.
              

* Fundamental of Artificial Intelligence Project

  date: July 2022 - September 2022
  
  Title: Smart Home with Prolog and Python
      
      Description: The goal of the project was to create a "smart environment" using Prolog and Python. The system was equipped with a graphical interface that allowed the user to create "preferences" based on their needs. An example could be the "night" mode, which once activated, by reading the values of both internal and external sensors present in the smart environment, regulated the actuators to satisfy the user's preferences.

  Title: Dibenedetto's Interpreter
      
      Description: The goal was to create an interpreter called DIBInt, using the functional language Haskell. To create DIBInt, it was first necessary to define a grammar for the language, after which the Parser was developed to analyze the textual input in order to then be able to execute the program, finally, functionalities and syntax were implemented, starting from the grammar of the interpreter.
